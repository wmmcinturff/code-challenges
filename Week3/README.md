## Instructions
1. In the README file that you create with your repo, write out explanations of the following concepts as if you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
    * Variables: In programming, variables can contain values that are either qualitative (based on characteristics) or quantitative (something you can count or measure). Examples are numbers, strings, and booleans.
    * Strings: Variables that store characters within double "" or single '' quotes. They can contain any text: e.g. "Taco Cat"; "October"; "Honda". Usually more descriptive or qualitative.
    * Functions (arguments, `return`): Functions can perform tasks and return values. You can think of a function as having an "Input" and an "Output". It's like a machine built with code. Example: function howToMultiply (num1, num2) {
        return num1 * num2; 
    }
    * `if` statements: "If" statements are examples of conditional statements. They can assess conditions and return outputs if the conditions you define are met. Often used to see if something is "true" or "false". 
    * Boolean values (`true`, `false`): Boolean values only have two possible answers: "true" or "false". They can be used in simple logic statements: e.g. "It is May 20, 2020."; "The car is red."
2. Complete the JS code in [Week3.js](Week3-JS-I.js)
3. Push up your code to your repo and submit your Assignment Card in ClassTrackerr
